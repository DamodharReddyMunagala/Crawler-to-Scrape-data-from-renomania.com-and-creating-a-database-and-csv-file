Under the aegis of its principal Archana Shah, the firm has won accolades and appreciation in the form of awards and publications as well.

New designs should be built in a way that they functionally and aesthetically have all necessary elements that a changing world demands as well as incorporate all such elements that maintain the lineage.” This thinking is reflected in most of her works and which are widely appreciated by the design fraternity as well as the clients. Her work ranges from corporate offices, luxury bungalows, conservation and recreation, to children’s rooms demanding a very subtle understanding.Archana believes that even a modern design style must have space for innovative use of local crafts and materials with a contemporary clean design sensibility.

We both passed out from the renowned School of Architecture, C.E.P.T , Ahmedabad in the year 1992. Sumeet  trained with Mr Raj Rewal in Delhi whereas Vishakha trained with Christopher Benninger in Pune.One of our earliest assignments was working for an Exhibition at Indira Gandhi Centre for Arts organised by Kapila Vatsayan way back in 1992.atrium-over the yearsIn the fourteen years of our practice we have constantly endeavored to create buildings that are totally in tune with their natural surroundings. We believe in creating a built form as a response to the context, climate and the social and cultural ethos of the place it is being built at. While in urban situations these factors may not seem so important; it is the buildings that we have made in the pristine hills of Uttranchal , the verdant greens of Goa or the jungle areas around Corbett that truly reflect our concern for these issues.In Almora we have built a hospital for the Jan Jaagran Samiti a NGO working for the upliftment of the weavers of Almora. The brief was to create a world class hospital that did not intimidate the poorest of the poor. We created a building using local materials and built forms –exposed Stone masonry walls with sloping roofs and borrowed local motifs as architectural ornamentation; and created a building around courtyards ensuring that the wards corridors and out patient areas were flooded with natural light and sunlight. The building was sited in a way that no existing tree was disturbed.We have over the years built quite a few hill and jungle resorts. While each resort has been designed using different materials and building elements –the common underlying principal governing the design has remained the same- built form that is essentially low key and segmented to  wrap around green spaces and existing trees and thus respecting the landscape that it is built in. The Kasaar Jungle Resort near Almora depicts this concept clearly –the thickly wooded site clearly dominated our planning so the hotel was built as a series of small structures wedged in between existing trees and oriented towards the breathtaking views of the snow clad Greater Himalayas.In the past we have also attempted at low cost Building Structures. A rural school in a village near Gaziabad for the P.K Education Society was designed by us in the late 90s. Confronted with some existing run down structures made of bricks in mud mortar, we had to create a fresh building for the school with minimum funds at disposal. The old structures were dismantled carefully without destroying the old bricks and all the new class rooms were built using rat trap brick work- (which minimises the bricks required ) with the old bricks from the dismantled structures.","[""Paschricha's House""]",['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/SG/aac4f133-32418-bedroom-wooden-flooring-in-bedroom-1.1.jpg'],[['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/aac4f133-32418-bedroom-wooden-flooring-in-bedroom-1.1.jpg']]

Either as a backdrop to the public realm or as a driver conducive to successful businesses, ANAGRAM believes that every building initiative does, and should count. It is this pursuit that drives ANAGRAM’s body of work.We believe in generating unique and progressive solutions to all design challenges. Understanding client requirements and the end user aspirations is very important to our design process, which is why the clients form a very important part of our team of collaborators. A continuous exploration in new materials and technology helps us in ever evolving our design approach and is well reflected in most of our projects. We also undertake self initiated collaboratives with other designers, academics and creative practitioners to enrich and invigorate our own experiences.Adherence to the highest standards of quality and efficiency in delivering, form the core of the ANAGRAM work ethic. The practice works in close collaboration with consultants, clients, vendors and specialist designers while meticulously studying development control guidelines in order to render complete and accurate construction information drawings. Innovation in design and technology is tested through adequate prototyping. From latest development in construction technology to traditional building practices, the work is informed by intensive research and contiguous training. ANAGRAM practises elaborate planning methodology to ensure timely delivery of all projects.The construction industry in India is a complex and vital economic sector albeit characterised by a largely unskilled workforce, lax statutory compliance, low technological innovation and an increasing resource footprint.

Rakesh Dhar and Ar. S.K. Goel. The two made a connection working together as recent architectural graduates at an architectural firm in Delhi, and decided to establish a partnership. With like-minded vision,  complimentary skill-set, mutual respect and admiration, a foundation of the firm’s identity was laid. What this entrepreneurial collaboration lacked in financial backing was more than made up for in unbridled energy, passion for the discipline and the will to labor continuously without frills, all the while upholding highest standard of professional ethics and integrity.From a venture of two people in a swim or sink situation to a firm employing 30 odd employees, the principals along with the establishment have come a long way. We remain a small practice by intention as principals prefer to direct and drive each project personally working together with clients so that every project turns out to be the best version of itself.We seek to design spaces that consistently express the needs, aspiration and identity of the occupants. The firm’s portfolio reflects the abiding desire in enriching human experience, thriving on our obsession of continuously improving upon the design solutions, bettering our previous best. We embrace the myriad desires of client and project considerations to craft solutions unique to the given parameters by considering each project as a design opportunity than a design problem. We ‘own’ our projects from the day of the inception of its idea to the day it is occupied. As designers, we don’t think of architecture as separate from interiors and our approach towards space creation blurs the distinction and blends the two.Within the firm, a simple, non hierarchical spread out structure exists. We operate in a common studio where project teams approach the task at hand in a highly collaborative environment. The roll-up-your- sleeves attitude of the principals sets the ethos of the team with a hands-on, energetic and adaptive outlook.","['SUNIL JAIN RESIDENCE', 'SUNIL DHAMA RESIDENCE', ' GEETA RESIDENCE', 'ARIHANT SOUTHWIND']","['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/SG/b89fb01b-31388-dining-elegant-dining-table-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/SG/bc92d6f9-31384-decor-white-wall-decor-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/SG/f2247858-31381-living-white-center-table-livingroom-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/SG/bb91ed32-31378-living-black-center-table-in-living-1.1.jpg']","[['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/b89fb01b-31388-dining-elegant-dining-table-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/f5b6740f-31387-bedroom-ceiling-cove-light-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/a5c191ac-31386-bath-black-white-bath-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/8102acd8-31385-outdoor-elegant-outdoor-1.1.jpg'], ['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/bc92d6f9-31384-decor-white-wall-decor-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/604b3caf-31383-living-ceiling-cove-light-in-living-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/edaa0089-31382-living-elegant-livingroom-1.1.jpg'], ['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/f2247858-31381-living-white-center-table-livingroom-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/852348ce-31380-living-modern-livingroom-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/5c173990-31379-living-white-wall-livngroom-1.1.jpg'], ['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/bb91ed32-31378-living-black-center-table-in-living-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/cec30806-31377-bedroom-wooden-flooring-in-bedroom-1.1.jpg']]"

Can the eternal nature of the soul be asserted physically through architecture? Does a structure, much like a human body, carry a soul within it? Architecture, much like music, art, poetry and culinary science, is the melding of eclectic elements in desired proportions that, if considered in isolation seems to induce a lot of vibrations, whereas their effective conglomeration shuns all the disturbance thus evoking a surreal sense of celebration and serenity. What appears to the eye as a calm sentinal, having gulped the history while swaying effortlessly in the moment, conceals beneath it the enormous impact of multiple layers combining social, economical and engineering paradigms distorted at will. Manifestation of Fluid Architecture (abbreviated M:OFA) is realisation of a design theory that redefine and reinvent architectural manifolds, moving beyond the clichéd world of regularised grids, dimensions, standards and principles. Here, the walls bend and column grids twist responding to the ever changing energy fields created by the life forms it houses.Every project brings along it an idea or a beautiful thought that gets nurtured through the journey of its manifestation, to take the form of a discernibly stronger foothold. At M:OFA, Architecture is deemed to be a more fluid expression that shares a profound symbiosis with the life form that dwell in and around it. It is a celebration of lines, tectonics, flow, nature, and everything that forms a part of the continuum.The designs with their broad sinuous bands of spaces, ever varying voids and effortless expanses are suggestive of freedom and unconformity. Here the landscapes rise and fall intermittently with melting voids prompting an amorphous interconnected succession of spaces.Fluidity, when regarded in terms of movement and intermolecular proximity open doors for various possibilities while the container/contained relationship divest it of the harmony that architecture shares with inside-outside world.Each architectural manifestation with its eccentricities and type of fluidity differs from the other in terms of the way the various forces conjoins. The structure is believed to be a receptive body that, more like a living organism, shares energies with the life forms in its proximity, and reciprocate in an adaptive gesture to the multiple changes that take place in its milieu. An amorphous body that dabbles in a field where the ever pulsating vibrations of life incessantly permeates through supercharging the entire structure with positive energies. Our Constant inspiration comes out from the ever-inspiring life and nature. The various instances that life throws in the pace of everyday life has so much in store to look, introspect, contemplate and extract. Our designs are an interpretation of these very snippets where we meticulously work to turn a beautiful image of a thought from the virtual canvas to reality.","['Wadhwa Residence', 'Sunil Goel Residence', 'Omaxe Nile Sample Apartments', 'Omaxe Forest Sample Apartment', 'Aman & Bina Mehra Penthouse']","['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/SG/c5fa3a2-30668-dining-glass-dining-table-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/SG/b4156d8a-30660-living-bamboo-blinds-in-living-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/SG/2511cc74-30658-living-brown-cushion-in-living-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/SG/95162e63-30654-decor-white-wall-in-decor-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/SG/84ee0b99-30648-1.1.jpg']","[['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/c5fa3a2-30668-dining-glass-dining-table-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/3c0561ee-30667-dining-mofa-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/4b025178-30666-living-white-center-table-in-living-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/6fc16c0c-30665-dining-white-wall-in-dining-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/18c65c9a-30664-living-white-sofa-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/42989fa7-30663-bedroom-wooden-flooring-in-bedroom-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/23c98cd-30662-bedroom-blue-cushion-in-bedroom-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/9b35c977-30661-living-white-sofa-1.1.jpg'], ['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/b4156d8a-30660-living-bamboo-blinds-in-living-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/21e8b4f6-30659-living-center-table-in-living-1.1.jpg'], ['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/2511cc74-30658-living-brown-cushion-in-living-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/e4cb17c5-30656-bedroom-traditional-bedroom-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/704c433d-30655-bedroom-wooden-chair-in-bedroom-1.1.jpg'], ['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/95162e63-30654-decor-white-wall-in-decor-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/eb0e5cee-30653-living-elegant-living-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/9c096c78-30652-bedroom-yellow-wall-in-bedroom-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/2362cb74-30651-bath-roman-blinds-in-bath-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/73152ed7-30650-living-wooden-chair-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/5b26d190-30649-living-yellow-wall-in-living-1.1.jpg'], ['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/84ee0b99-30648-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/f9a3f464-30647-lighting-wall-light-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/f4629a27-30646-bath-wooden-flooring-in-bath-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/978dc72d-30645-living-wooden-ceiling-in-living-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/5d409b75-30644-living-white-wall-in-living-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/be57088e-30643-bath-elegant-bath-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/749a54d6-30642-living-wooden-flooring-in-living-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/68224882-30641-bedroom-white-wall-in-bedroom-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/1f257814-30640-bar-white-wall-in-bar-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/94723ab9-30639-living-mosaic-patterned-floor-in-living-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/4390d5f2-30638-dining-white-wall-in-dining-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/81e6ae8-30637-dining-elegant-dining-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/7f195a7e-30636-living-book-shelves-in-living-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/3b86d241-30635-living-wooden-flooring-in-living-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/4c81e2d7-30634-living-elaborate-livingroom-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/1f4d9b63-30633-bath-modern-bath-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/ca8b332e-30632-staircase-wooden-staircase-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/75e09422-30631-living-center-table-in-living-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/187d4f2a-30630-bedroom-wooden-flooring-in-bedroom-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/3f96a6b1-30629-outdoor-modern-outdoor-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/e87449fa-30628-kids-wooden-flooring-in-kidsroom-1.2.jpg']]"

At ADND, co-founded by Ar. Anand Menon and Ar. Shobhan Kothari, the partnership has encouraged dialogue on design possibilities and challenges that come with it thus creating visually striking spaces delivered within the parameters of pragmatics. The designers engaged at the firm further propel this idea of continuance and prevent stagnation of thought.ADND is an architecture + interior firm doing boutique work in the genre of residential, corporate, hospitality and retail. The firm has successfully completed 12 years in practice and has a growing body of work with some of the renowned names of the society. The firm has a team of 20+ designers aligned and determined to create a niche in the field of architecture and interior and to meet with client satisfaction. At ADND, design is treated as a process; something arrived with due consideration of pragmatics but not limited by them. The firm dwells in atmosphere of “studio” practice combined with a sense of realism.The firm constantly strives for a clarity of thought when it comes to the realization of spaces be it architecture or interiors. Our belief that we are as good as our last completed project has persistently pushed us to strive for better. Our self critical nature helps us to take compliments and criticism in the same stride.After completion of 12 years in practice, the firm believes it retains “heart” of a child but with vast experiences to guide its future clients/projects.SERVICESADND believes that there needs to be the right interface between the client’s vision and the execution on site. The firm provides this interface and helps bridge any gaps that may arise during the course of the project. At ADND collaboration with its clients to build an image appropriate for the project is imperative. The firm handles the entire spectrum from design concept to supervision of a project. The attempt at the firm is to develop an all-inclusive program for its users along with creative design intervention that is far more intense in its goals. To achieve these goals the team at ADND has put a 5 point process list to enable us to deliver the project.","['SW Residence', 'NG Residence', 'D Residence', 'AVS Residence', 'AS Residence', 'AA

This restricts us from following any definite style of work and the form evolves after taking into consideration the function and the site specific environment. Yet the form is independent enough to be unique. While deriving the form, a tread is constantly tied to the energies around the building and how to make the building energy efficient. This encourages us to use local materials, craft persons and appropriate technologies.All and all we strive to give you a product which is functionally efficient, aesthetically pleasing, responds positively to climatic factors, and age gracefully.","[""Sheetal and Ram's Residence"", ""Radhika and Amit's Residence"", 'House Interiors']","['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/SG/aaca9287-30448-living-wooden-ceiling-in-living-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/SG/339b9f35-30446-dining-modern-dining-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/SG/a3aad84e-30445-storage-open-shelves-1.1.jpg']","[['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/aaca9287-30448-living-wooden-ceiling-in-living-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/4706894e-30447-bar-fabric-curtain-in-bar-1.1.jpg'], ['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/339b9f35-30446-dining-modern-dining-1.1.jpg'], ['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/a3aad84e-30445-storage-open-shelves-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/ecd6c9f8-30444-bedroom-modern-bedroom-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/2609eef1-30443-dining-yellow-wall-in-dining-1.1.jpg']]"

Where they achieve creative breakthroughs. Where they live life and comfort one another. Where performance is both performed and witnessed. Where memories occur. Architecture is a backdrop to all of these experiences. Our philosophy is to make it great, every single time. Our designs break away from cookie-cutter design and traditional aesthetics. It strives to create designs that go beyond “standard” ideas and instead pursue projects inspired by layout, location, and function Designs are typically free of clutter and unnecessary elements. The goals of the project are clarified at the start, and only the features that are required are included in the design. in many of our designs, you will find strong linear elements and bold horizontal and vertical features. Beams, posts, cutouts, windows, staircases, roof lines, and other structural elements all assist the architect in creating a linear-inspired space.Our designs deconstruct traditional structures and are characterized by the simplification of form. It does not necessarily follow convention or symmetry - rather, it concentrates on clean lines. It is original, highly personalized and has a sense of play.","['Residence of Mr Murali and Mr Shridhar', 'Residence of Mr Chandra Shekar', 'Residence for Mr Ashok Kumar', 'Bedroom for Mr Varun and Mr Sharan']","['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/SG/dbbdfc52-25417-dining-brown-wall-in-dining-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/SG/ced758cd-25403-bath-white-black-bath-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/SG/5ed3303d-25400-puja-marble-flooring-in-pujaroom-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/SG/18930118-25397-bedroom-elegant-bedroom-1.1.jpg']","[['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/dbbdfc52-25417-dining-brown-wall-in-dining-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/cce6798f-25416-lobby-modern-lobby-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/48c09b26-25415-dining-wooden-ceiling-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/255d402e-25414-living-brown-sofa-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/21836c76-25413-bedroom-elegant-bedroom-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/963d3676-25412-dining-wooden-chair-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/30fa1e61-25411-bedroom-elegant-bedroom-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/d14e89-25410-bedroom-wooden-flooring-in-bedroom-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/6016c76c-25409-living-wooden-chair-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/b7f42827-25408-living-marble-flooring-in-lig-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/1aa10b1d-25407-bedroom-elegant-bedroom-1.2.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/8cc8ff26-25406-bath-elegant-bath-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/68b2a8c4-25405-bedroom-modern-bedroom-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/a27ff49c-25404-bedroom-wooden-flooring-in-bedroom-1.1.jpg'], ['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/ced758cd-25403-bath-white-black-bath-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/6446b1de-25402-lighting-pendant-lighting-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/bcc4fb14-25401-lighting-elegant-lighting-1.1.jpg'], ['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/5ed3303d-25400-puja-marble-flooring-in-pujaroom-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/e918cecb-25399-bath-small-bath-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/9e1ffe5d-25398-puja-traditional-pujaroom-1.1.jpg'], ['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/18930118-25397-bedroom-elegant-bedroom-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/97567a38-25396-bedroom-wooden-blinds-in-bedroom-1.1.jpg']]"

The firm offers architecture and interior design services, and over the course of a decade in the practice, has handled projects in the residential, commercial, hospitality and institutional sectors.The firm comprises a team of young professionals attuned to the modern aesthetic and psyche- and thus strives to produce designs that are relevant, practical, client specific and sensitive to environmental and climatoligical concerns.Philosophy:Just as nature does, in art and architecture - form, space, scale, colour and material influence thought and emotion. The difference between an architect and a space planner is that good architecture/ interior design is expected to go beyond successfully answering the client's space and practical requirements and infuse the designed space with spirit. A well conceived space designed with sensitivity can manipulate the human mind (in all the best ways possible) and induce an uplifting of the spirit.Thus, in each project that Billimoria & Associates undertakes, in addition to using our technical skills to address the client's requirements, we also like to define at the outset, our goal in terms of the mood, emotion, feelings , we would want our spaces to induce.","[""Subramanyam's Residence""]",['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/SG/8f6da059-30413-living-white-wall-in-living-1.1.jpg'],"[['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/8f6da059-30413-living-white-wall-in-living-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/927f2cd3-30412-living-center-table-in-living-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/b6bc11a7-30411-multipurpose-wooden-flooring-in-multipurpose-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/fc511f9a-30410-dining-contemporary-dining-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/41004ffa-30409-living-white-wall-in-living-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/f6be15fa-30408-outdoor-modern-outdoor-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/84c62b80-30407-staircase-wooden-staircase-1.1.jpg']]"

The Company is primarily engaged into interior designing, planning and providing consultancy. Inspired by the skills and creativity of the various craftsmen around the world, an interior expression was launched with the sole intention of putting space to better use and to enhance the quality of living by enhancing the beauty and utility. Sayyam Interiors believes in the strength of design. When considering our works and what is of value to us in design, it is important to appreciate that we devote ourselves entirely to each separate project. Mr. Rahul Chordiya is involved intimately and directly in all aspects, from conceptualization to execution to completion. It is our avowed aim to create offices for corporates, which along with aesthetics is designed in a manner so as to increase the productivity levels. It is the high standard of our work and professional approach to each and every assignments we take up, which makes our Company a name to reckon with, in the domain of corporate interior designing. We combine practical knowledge with our artistic skills to turn abstract ideas into formal designs. Designing for home is quite different from that of corporate offices. We plan the space and design the interiors according to the client’s tastes, needs and budget. The primary parameter guiding home designing is that of “comfort”.

Grace and elegance are not just sentiments to strive for, they are embodied in all the things around us. Knowing this we simply answer the inner calling of those who want to live artistically and in beautiful spaces that enhance the sense of being.”Essentia embodies global refinement and an indigenous design sense reflective of the contemporary & classic designs from the world of interiors. The creative calling of leading interior design duo Monica and Hardesh Chawla - Essentia Environments is India's premier design and build company that also happens to be one of the most innovative. Mrs. & Mr. Chawla founded Essentia Environments in 1999 with the object of carrying out the business of interior design, turnkey execution, manufacturing and supplying furniture and home decor accessories to their discerning clients. For the last fifteen years, Monica & Hardesh have been designing and building dream spaces for their clients and have in the process redefined elegant luxury.An extremely original & personal signature characterizes this brand, which is synonymous with innovation, style and sophistication. “We consciously try to design spaces so that they are clean and clutter free. We enhance the given positives of a site and try to camouflage the negatives. Above all we strive for simplicity and that is what adds sophistication to our work” says Monica. Essentia Environments intends to literally transform the lives of its patrons by providing a space that is wondrous, comfortable, yet practical with the only constant being luxury and elegance. Their work is unusual with its commitment to both design and execution. The couple creates designs by borrowing elements from the past and fusing them with international contemporary trends using their evolved sensibilities. However, what mostly sets Essentia apart is the complete in house capability to execute all of the designs that the creative team comes up with. A large team of professionals with unparalleled manufacturing support allows the company to handle multiple projects in multiple locations with skill and justifiable confidence. Having designed and executed over 400 projects, the principals still think of themselves as evolving and ever hungry for bigger challenges. “More than the technical knowhow which in itself is an ever evolving and shifting target, what one really needs in abundance to create dream spaces is a generous attitude and infinite patience” feels Hardesh. In synopsis, Essentia Environments endeavors to constantly better its best and continue to be recognized as India's foremost Interior Design and Build Company.","['Farmhouse in Kundli', 'Show

I've always had good aesthetic sense and an eye for detail, but I never went beyond treating my interest in interior design as more than a hobby.An internship with an architect changed all that. During those 2 weeks, I discovered the scope and magic of Interior Design. I realized that there is so much more to design than just décor and details. Spurred on by the internship, I finally decided to teach myself the technical aspects of design, and started working with Murthy & Manyam as their Interior Designer – designing while learning on the job.I am proud of what I achieved in those 2 years at M&M and thereafter. Starting off with a limited understanding of interior design, I've designed an entire university in Hyderabad for Symbiosis, one of the most acclaimed restaurants and multiple residential projects, in and outside Hyderabad.I am versatile and like to understand my clients’ requirements and preferences and incorporate them in my design. I do not tie myself down with a specific style. In my portfolio, every space is different.","['Banjara Hills House', 'Banjara Hills Apartment']","['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/SG/dab9ba4e-23639-living-traditional-chair-1.0.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/SG/e14d772-23633-bedroom-modern-bedroom-1.1.jpg']","[['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/dab9ba4e-23639-living-traditional-chair-1.0.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/95c5abf8-23638-decor-wooden-decor-1.0.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/5e5e690c-23637-decor-wooden-decor-1.0.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/e67f5ec3-23636-decor-playful-decor-1.0.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/3f459bc2-23635-dining-dark-wooden-chair-in-dining-1.0.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/83e79005-23634-decor-white-wall-in-decor-1.0.jpg'], ['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/e14d772-23633-bedroom-modern-bedroom-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/171c0a13-23632-living-purple-wall-in-living-1.0.jpg']]"

Vipul Patel. The firm has successfully worked on and completed over 200 projects since its commencement. The projects vary from individual residences, commercial complexes, apartment schemes, exhibition spaces, corporate offices, and retail spaces to institutional buildings. The firm undertakes architectural and interior designing projects, having a team of commendable architects, designers and draftsmen.We, at VPA, believe that ""architecture has nothing to do with how a building looks like, but more to do with the functional spaces"" and our projects are a strong reflection of the same. Our designs are an amalgamation of contemporary straight line work, functional comfort, client's satisfaction and requirements along with creativity. We affirmatively focus more on practicality in our projects followed by aesthetics. Our projects and designs echo this firm dictum of the company.Moreover, we place our client's satisfaction and requirements as our upmost goal. We are aware of the dreams our clients approach us with, and we do our best to make that a reality.","['Praful Bhai and Rajshree Ben House', 'Dual House', 'Chandresh Patel Residence']","['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/SG/51e3c067-27190-dining-white-wall-in-dining-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/SG/8eded912-27170-living-contemporary-livingroom-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/SG/9682afd6-27162-bedroom-purple-wall-in-bedroom-1.1.jpg']","[['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/51e3c067-27190-dining-white-wall-in-dining-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/ecb29007-27189-bedroom-green-cushion-in-bedroom-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/9bb5a091-27188-living-wooden-flooring-in-living-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/2c7a6835-27187-living-wooden-ceiling-in-living-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/3b21ede8-27186-kitchen-marble-flooring-in-kitchen-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/2cd638f-27185-bedroom-fabric-curtain-in-bedroom-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/655ecac3-27184-living-wooden-ceiling-in-living-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/26ac86e5-27183-living-elegant-livingroom-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/cb110f88-27182-bedroom-wooden-flooring-in-bedroom-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/52185e32-27181-living-sheer-curtain-in-living-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/3830ddb7-27180-bedroom-fabric-curtain-in-bedroom-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/1784bc7-27179-bath-elegant-bath-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/abe9a2d4-27178-living-sheer-curtain-in-living-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/c1b0b3f5-27177-bedroom-elegant-bedroom-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/760ee9f5-27176-bedroom-roman-blinds-in-bedroom-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/52cdd481-27175-bedroom-fabric-curtains-in-bedroom-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/c792443f-27174-bath-counter-top-wash-basin-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/59f6d19c-27173-living-white-marble-flooring-in-living-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/75e011e4-27172-bedroom-tile-flooring-in-bedroom-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/317f99db-27171-bedroom-white-wall-in-bedroom-1.1.jpg'], ['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/8eded912-27170-living-contemporary-livingroom-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/53d33c39-27169-lobby-grey-wall-in-lobby-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/59a70af7-27168-dining-sheer-curtain-in-dining-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/74d27ba8-27167-living-modern-livingroom-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/de4392bb-27166-dining-white-wall-in-dining-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/bcbeec32-27165-living-wooden-flooring-in-living-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/162f0521-27164-living-black-sofa-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/af3b45b7-27163-lobby-elegant-lobby-1.1.jpg'], ['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/9682afd6-27162-bedroom-purple-wall-in-bedroom-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/754da0b9-27161-bedroom-white-wall-in-bedroom-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/f8ac9c9f-27160-dining-modern-dining-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/77cbae7d-27159-kitchen-white-kitchen-cabinet-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/cc9eeb-27158-dining-pendant-light-in-dining-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/2db9efb4-27157-living-marble-flooring-in-living-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/5abedf22-27156-bedroom-wooden-flooring-in-bedroom-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/c3b78e98-27155-bedroom-roman-blinds-in-bedroom-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/6926678b-27154-dining-wooden-chair-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/ea6d413b-27153-living-white-wall-in-living-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/40fca828-27152-bedroom-ceiling-cove-light-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/8e4d0036-27151-living-center-table-in-living-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/44805c6e-27150-living-modern-livingroom-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/5934d3d3-27149-living-elegant-livingroom-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/89636415-27148-bedroom-wooden-flooring-in-bedroom-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/8912f6b1-27146-bedroom-fabric-curtain-in-bedroom-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/70471240-27145-living-elegant-livingroom-1.1.jpg']]"

The studio works closely on each program and situates its projects within a wider research context.We believe in an integrated approach, which is complex, generative and moves beyond the digital techniques. We are constantly engaging in the practices of ‘Regenerative Architecture’ that focuses on conservation and performance through a focused reduction on the environmental impacts of a built structure.The Studio is working on experiments which are based in the present day scenario (as prototypes) which when multiplied, would breed into a series of ‘Eco-cities’, set in the future. These experiments focus on the ‘Kilometer Zero’ concept, which strives to generate locally everything that is necessary for our living.”The underlying focus is to integrate the ideas of our architectural theories using a series of integrated/hybrid techniques to develop a new breed of regenerative architecture.","['KING’S HOUSE – DUPLEX', 'KING’S HOUSE', 'COURTYARD HOUSE']","['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/SG/e4dca160-26864-study-wooden-wall-in-studyroom-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/SG/c2b51024-26856-lobby-elegant-lobby-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/SG/da88ba1c-26851-staircase-wooden-staircase-1.1.jpg']","[['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/e4dca160-26864-study-wooden-wall-in-studyroom-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/5dc8e1f6-26863-bedroom-modern-bedroom-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/2acfd160-26862-multipurpose-wooden-flooring-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/e0cec14-26861-multipurpose-granite-flooring-in-multipurpose-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/478dada-26860-bar-elegant-bar-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/36d584f6-26859-kitchen-white-wall-in-kitchen-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/9c446de5-26858-living-sheer-curtain-in-living-1.3.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/333509d9-26857-living-wooden-wall-in-living-1.1.jpg'], ['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/c2b51024-26856-lobby-elegant-lobby-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/e6762d50-26855-bedroom-sheer-curtain-in-bedroom-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/4ce7c443-26854-bath-wooden-ceiling-in-bath-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/d28351e0-26853-bath-counter-top-wash-basin-1.4.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/b8abd265-26852-lobby-wooden-ceiling-in-lobby-1.1.jpg'], ['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/da88ba1c-26851-staircase-wooden-staircase-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/b7156114-26850-staircase-elegant-staircase-1.1.jpg']]"

Eponymously named after its founder, it started at a time when the concept of interior design was first making its way into Indian homes. An architect first, Jami’s guiding principal has always been a seamless integration of form and function. It is precisely with this design vision that he has moulded his company, now forging on in its fourth decade.JJA has a vast repertoire of clients in Mumbai and different parts of India and operates primarily in the fields of Architecture and Interior Design. From luxurious homes, villas, offices and private residences to showrooms, commercial spaces and even holiday resorts, JJA has successfully made its mark in all design spheres. With a talented team of architects and designers, JJA has successfully conceptualized and completed the interior designs of numerous residential and commercial projects, architectural projects and more recently, have introduced Architectural Design to their list of services as well.Although the expertise carefully culled over the past forty years serves as the guiding force behind their superlative exterior and interior design work, the infusion of young blood through Suzan Banajee and Karaan Jambusarwala has ensured that the promise of quality, style and functionality that JJA stands for will continue undeterred. The siblings bring with them a modern approach in keeping with the times ready to uphold the reputation for masterful planning and utilization of space coupled with an eye for elegance and detail that JJA is known for. So they can also ensure that no two JJA interior or architecture are ever are ever the same.

The purpose was to set up a design practice that has a process oriented approach to design. We strive to achieve the client's goals through the process of research. Our team ensures that the design solution provided generates an environment that surpasses trends and fads by offering a more enriching spatial experience. We started as a two person team and have now grown to a team of over 30 architects and interior designers.    Our assignments include product design, interior design, architectural design and urban design.    The process and approach towards each is equally rigorous and comprehensive.    Our designs accommodate the 'perceptions' of users / clients and understand that there are no absolute solutions to any design project.    We strive to find creative and innovative responses that are specific to site, client and proposed users.

Studio AVT firmly believes in the uttermost importance of the space within & beyond rather than the built frame. We endeavor to design and develop an environment for stories to take birth and remain, where true feelings are captured and felt with a sense of belonging, only to resonate through time. “We intend to breathe” is what our motto is. The journey began in the year 2010, following the birth of “Studio An-V-Thot”, a Design Consultancy firm based in Delhi. Since then the studio has taken up and completed several Architectural and Interior projects of varied nature, scale and sizes. The studio’s core effort to convert a thought into reality has consistently led them for pursuit of excellence.","['Residential-Young Wine', 'Residential-The Plus House']","['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/SG/28274230-18702-storage-white-tv-cabinet-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/SG/57a07ce7-18692-staircase-elegant-staircase-1.2.jpg']","[['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/28274230-18702-storage-white-tv-cabinet-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/798863d5-18701-living-contemporary-livingroom-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/5937aae7-18700-bedroom-studio-an-v-thot-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/89b15525-18699-living-playful-centre-table-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/425b0575-18698-storage-white-chest-of-drawers-1.2.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/54d91727-18697-dining-ceiling-pendent-light-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/4befdcab-18696-dining-wooden-chair-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/c3603748-18695-bedroom-elegant-bedroom-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/cc851e0d-18694-decor-elegant-decor-1.2.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/3ebe9be7-18693-kitchen-white-kitchen-cabinet-1.2.jpg'], ['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/57a07ce7-18692-staircase-elegant-staircase-1.2.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/751a2c6d-18691-lobby-white-marble-flooring-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/5034fad4-18690-kitchen-minimalist-kitchen-1.3.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/a483ff95-18689-staircase-wooden-staircase-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/dbaefa41-18688-dining-elegant-dining-1.3.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/b4f97728-18687-lobby-wooden-flooring-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/a633ed7e-18686-bedroom-elegant-bedroom-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/4dd6d753-18685-decor-white-wall-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/6d64c221-18684-bedroom-white-and-green-wall-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/f81c0645-18683-living-cream-wall-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/f37a1308-18682-outdoor-wooden-ceiling-1.2.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/346c2e14-18681-multipurpose-beige-marble-flooring-1.3.jpg']]"

Shared experiences over the years make every project we take on enjoyable. Our approach is very chaotic upfront. Our team is intrinsically involved from the get-go; several ideas are put on the table and worked through laterally. Essentially, our expression is based on the concerns we develop while understanding what the task is at hand. These concerns are then translated into a physical tangible buildable construct using our own personal intuitive logic – rational decisions based on relevance, appropriateness, technology, budgets, craftsmanship, locale, the list is too long…SPASM is not interested in being avant-garde. Like Marcel Proust said, “To see new landscapes you don’t need to always journey, but have new eyes.” We try to be very human in our approach and not too fussy in our details. We do try to bring a poetic touch to our expression but never at the cost of appropriateness. An eastern kind of “inclusivity” is sought; every aspect of building, occupation and future ageing of projects is mulled over – many, many, many times over. Every commission is an opportunity to discover ourselves, through what we propose and build.","['The Brick Kiln House', 'Khadakvasla House']","['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/SG/6dae05b1-26677-outdoor-rustic-outdoor-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/SG/44f146d6-26672-outdoor-traditioanl-outdoor-1.1.jpg']","[['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/6dae05b1-26677-outdoor-rustic-outdoor-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/1aa93527-26676-bath-brick-wall-in-bath-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/9e8fd78e-26675-outdoor-traditional-outdoor-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/ac80c060-26674-outdoor-rustic-outdoor-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/48220b16-26673-outdoor-brick-wall-in-outdoor-1.1.jpg'], ['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/44f146d6-26672-outdoor-traditioanl-outdoor-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/ddf8176c-26671-bath-white-wall-in-bath-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/dd8253e6-26670-1.0.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/60d30386-26669-bath-counter-top-wash-basin-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/281a4abd-26668-outdoor-elegant-outdoor-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/42435b9c-26667-outdoor-wooden-outdoor-1.1.jpg']]"

His passion for designing was spawned under the guidance of his father, the Late Mr. Qasim Duberia (Chartered Architect). Being exposed to his father's work across the Gulf Countries shaped Mr. Sufyan's understanding of space and giving vast exposure to modern luxury and design elements. Over the course of two decades SDA Designs have helped shape several interior and architectural projects, spanning across India, U.A.E. & K.S.A., offering services comprising conceptualization, planning, strategy, project management and more. SDA Designs cater to a wide array of projects, varying in nature and scale, from homes, offices, industrial complexes, hospitality sector, etc. Living in a globally accessible world, SDA Designs moves forward with awareness, providing design and planning that reflects and foresees growth of space as well as its occupants. One of the endearing qualities of our design that often demand praise is the simplicity of the overall design.

A strong desire to contribute creatively to this magical world of decor and interiors led to its inception. Dezineground started off at the very basic level with the founders doing basic works, right from supervision to AUTOCAD designing. Born out of dust (literally !) and paint residue, we now can proudly boast of close to thirty projects under our (designer) caps.Dezineground has painstakingly given attention to the finest details in every project and we have our entourage of happy clients to vouch for us.Bharathi and Shwetambari are the designers behind dezineground. Their boring technical degrees earlier on helped them in realizing the actual joy in the field of art.Both of them went on to get their degrees in Interior design and that is where the idea for Dezineground was born. Being a product of their creative heart, dezineground is something that they do for the love of it.","['Vasudeva Villas 2', 'Vasudeva Villas 1', 'Modern Home Designs', 'Amzing Pictures']","['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/SG/db78000c-23200-kids-elegant-kids-room-1.0.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/SG/ff1f1a5c-23196-kids-playful-kids-room-1.0.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/SG/50a73bdd-23191-kids-elegant-kids-room-1.0.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/SG/fd204526-23189-decor-wooden-wall-shelves-1.0.jpg']","[['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/db78000c-23200-kids-elegant-kids-room-1.0.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/a58e72fc-23199-bedroom-yellow-wall-in-bedroom-1.0.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/b8059395-23198-kids-orange-cabinet-in-kids-1.0.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/db23ef66-23197-kids-cream-wall-in-kids-room-1.0.jpg'], ['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/ff1f1a5c-23196-kids-playful-kids-room-1.0.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/de4d38a3-23195-kids-colourful-kids-room-1.0.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/a5d62ef4-23194-living-modern-livingroom-1.0.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/df4d6071-23193-decor-traditional-decor-1.0.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/4238c58d-23192-storage-cream-wall-in-storage-1.0.jpg'], ['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/50a73bdd-23191-kids-elegant-kids-room-1.0.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/ac3d96c1-23190-dining-dark-wooden-chair-1.0.jpg'], ['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/fd204526-23189-decor-wooden-wall-shelves-1.0.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/3563f230-23188-living-beige-sofa-in-living-1.0.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/dc19fa7a-23187-decor-elegant-decor-1.0.jpg']]"

Mike started his career in the UK, working with companies such as Roche Bobois.Preeti and Mike later set up their interior design studio in London in the swanky St John's Wood High Street. Their clientele was high end residential as well as commercial.The next step was a furniture export business from India which is still going strong many years later. It was partly due to this business that Mike and Preeti moved to India 15 years ago, with no intention of staying for so long.The excitement of working with local craftsmen and materials led to some unusual furniture being produced, which has become the hallmark of Mike and Preeti’s company. Ayurvedic woods such as neem and jamun were used to make furniture with organic shapes, among a variety of other experimental furniture. Many projects have been completed successfully over the years.The interiors at the Hidden Gallery have a strong European aesthetic, due to the fact that Mike and Preeti were both weaned on design in the UK. Most of the products for their interiors are designed and made in their workshops. The range goes from farmhouse rustic to fine furniture.Preeti believes an interior is a bit like set design.

It is also about revisiting older trends that were set decades ago and reinterpreting them in a fresh and contemporary way.So is the philosophy of FADD Studio. While FADD is an acronym for Farah and Dhaval Design, it is also a play on the word ‘fad’. It is easy to stagnate into a style that becomes a firm’s identity. And we believe that having a singular style defies the purpose of design, which is to push beyond what we known, achieve something novel and unique in every project, and be constantly propelled out of our comfort zone into a world where we not only embrace new concepts and techniques but also create fads of our own. With this stubborn sensibility and desire to be original, we aspire not to create a style unique to us but to give you a design identity that is exclusive to you and your space whether it’s a home, restaurant or store.FADD Studio was founded in 2012 in Bangalore by Farah Ahmed, who studied at Instituto Marangoni in Milan and Dhaval Shellugar who Studied at Rachana Sasand’s Academy of Architecture and Design in Bombay. Both met while working at Khosla Associates under Sandeep Khosla and Amaresh Anand.FADD Studio’s projects range from residences to offices and retail spaces to hospitality. Currently, the studio is designing a music lounge in Bangalore, a house boat in Goa, luxury villas in the outskirts of Bangalore and a holiday home in the heart of Bangalore.","['WHITE LODGE APARTMENT', 'NADHANI RESIDENCE', 'KINI RESIDENCE']","['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/SG/f840c1c9-23437-bath-brown-wall-in-bath-1.0.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/SG/c73ca3c4-23077-1.0.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/SG/3e4b579b-22226-dining-pendant-light-in-dining-1.1.jpg']","[['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/f840c1c9-23437-bath-brown-wall-in-bath-1.0.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/203d434d-23436-dining-elegant-dining-1.0.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/70f215b3-23435-living-white-sofa-in-living-1.0.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/16739f7c-23434-living-white-wall-in-living-1.0.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/da64731-23433-lobby-big-lobby-1.0.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/36a46995-23432-bedroom-modern-bedroom-1.0.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/d65d027f-23431-dining-pendant-light-in-dining-1.0.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/ebcd785e-23430-living-white-wall-in-living-1.0.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/af4c400b-23429-living-elegant-livingroom-1.0.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/c14d53ce-23428-living-fabric-curtains-in-living-1.0.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/c96cb0a2-23427-bedroom-modern-bedroom-1.0.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/75cebb65-23426-living-white-sofa-in-living-1.0.jpg'], ['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/c73ca3c4-23077-1.0.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/f0a2aba1-23076-1.0.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/1b00ea9f-23075-dining-elegant-dining-table-1.0.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/51d8cb29-23074-storage-open-shelves-in-storage-1.0.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/ff47e6a0-23073-living-center-table-in-living-1.2.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/a8b07405-23072-storage-beige-marble-flooring-in-storage-1.0.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/b51a4bd2-23071-living-elegant-livingroom-1.0.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/6f9d98a0-23070-living-floral-sofa-in-living-1.0.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/9fa9a1e9-23069-bath-counter-top-wash-basin-1.0.jpg'], ['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/3e4b579b-22226-dining-pendant-light-in-dining-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/efc4241b-22225-outdoor-wooden-flooring-in-outdoor-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/e9191b9f-22224-outdoor-black-center-table-in-outdoor-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/8fbfc58a-22223-bedroom-traditional-bedroom-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/8d1e0e48-22220-dining-playful-dining-table-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/8a3f12fe-22219-living-beige-sofa-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/f5556c39-22218-lobby-beige-marble-flooring-in-lobby-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/3267a787-22217-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/45609711-22216-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/46d37f50-22215-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/ec429643-22214-1.1.jpg']]"

A space she shares with her friends, studies in, does her homework or where she lives her fantasy world.Children’s rooms are designed with little attention to detail, a colour here and a colour there, with cartoon characters on the wall. Though this tells us it’s a kid’s room, it does not usually fulfill the needs of the child for whom it is made.We believe that a kids room may be called a bedroom, but it is much more that that.

Her friends and relatives asking for advice on How they might incorporate their new purchases into their homes. Decorating quickly replace shop keeping and the firm began to grow. Today, Rita employs two designers and assistants whose passion mirors hers as they create beautiful interiors while providing an unsurpassed level of service and personal attention to their diverse projects. Rita has fostered a work environment where learning is key, sharing knowledge is essential, and every aspect of a project from the first conceptual floor plans to final delivery of flowers, is considered an integral part. Though projects range from a contemporary high-rise apartment to a Victorian cottage in the city to sprawling estate hundreds of kilo meter away, each is negotiated with the same deft consideration and expertise.Rita Bheda is an interior designer of singular talent and sophistication, with career infirmed by life time of study, observation, and an unending pursuit to create the most gracious interiors possible. A voracious reader, antiquaire, and student of the arts, Rita strives to infuse each project with her seemingly boundless knowledge, wide ranging experience, and unerring sense of personal style. Of equal importance to the design process are close-knit relationships that Rita forms with her clients.

She earned a nomination in the category of a Retail space in 2003 and was a runner-up in the category of a Residential in 2004 respectively; at the esteemed Indian Institute of Interior Designers Award presentations.She subsequently won in the category of a residential space in 2009 and a National Commendation in 2013 in the Hospitality category at the Indian Institute of Interior Designers awards.Her recent works have earned her tags like “post –modern” vintage designer to “purveyor of the past”. This has probably stemmed from an emotive subconscious response to the growing fact that India, especially Mumbai is slowly losing the “in-between” era, where there was abundant aesthetic in the way simple folk lived- something that is now missing from our architecture.“We still suffer from a colonial hangover while we grapple with what identity to adopt today as a people.In my own small way I’d like to remind my conscience, that it is possible to breathe life into painstakingly constructed vernacular elements of old structures and adapt them in our very edgy, modern lifestyle.”In 2012, she also founded Ironworks- an esoteric line of furniture, accessories and linen for that laid-back chilled- out home.“With Ironworks, we want to constantly reclaim visions of a glorious past than can seamlessly blend with the way we choose to live today keeping in mind the individualistic and whimsical tastes of the evolved home owner.An era I aptly call “Industrial Vintage”. Each piece of furniture has been made from natural wood ethically grown in cultivated forests and is handcrafted embodying traditional carpentry along with industrial techniques. From coffee tables, case goods trunks, lamps to wine chillers, Ironworks will continue to cover our mundane use of furniture as gracefully.”",['BANDRA RESIDENCE'],['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/SG/e46d8958-22364-bath-traditional-bath-1.1.jpg'],"[['https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/e46d8958-22364-bath-traditional-bath-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/c7f65fbe-22363-bedroom-wooden-bedroom-1.2.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/f0c2fb93-22362-dining-wooden-ceiling-in-dining-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/1a35e23d-22361-living-beige-sofa-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/5e608dc7-22360-staircase-elegant-staircase-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/9739fcd8-22359-staircase-wooden-staircase-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/2a33f234-22358-dining-elegant-dining-table-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/1a84e723-22357-living-modern-bedroom-1.1.jpg', 'https://mediacdn.renomania.com/photos/BG/f2766735-22356-1.1.jpg']]"

Dal 1998 la sua professione è rivolta al product design ed all'interior design ricercando un connubio tra materiali primari e lavorati, per dare armonia alle forme, identificandole in elementi di uso quotidiano e ricercando nei metodi di riciclo i materiali di scarto da applicare al design. Inoltre grazie ad i contatti con aziende di ricerca e sviluppo prodotti, si adopera nella progettazione di prodotti che applicano materiali innovativi. Nel 2004 fonda il suo studio a Bagheria, dove vive e progetta i suoi lavori, che vengono commissionati da aziende internazionali. La sua attività riguarda:Product design: progetta dal complemento d'arredo ai sistemi di illuminazione, dalla pavimentazione al mobile e collabora con diverse aziende note a livello nazionale ed internazionale come Officine Mandelli, Francolight, Fogazza, Waterjet G&G, Calligaris, Snaidero, Europeo.Senior interior designer per Bhartiya City Developers a Bangalore, ha seguito la progettazione di interni per appartamenti privati, ma le sue competenze sono rivolte anche al settore retail e shopfitting, comprendente la progettazione e la ristrutturazione di locali pubblici, ponendo attenzione ai materiali innovativi che si prospettano sul mercato per caratterizzare ogni singolo ambiente. Inoltre in qualità di home shopper cura il progetto in tutte le fasi offrendo una consulenza d'arredo, interpretando gusti, attitudini e specifiche esigenze della committenza, proponendo la propria consulenza negli acquisti o addirittura sostituendola quando gli è richiesto.Affascinato e curioso di ciò che lo circonda poiché lo considera fonte di ispirazione per i suoi progetti, ne trae l'essenza sviluppando lavori che interagiscono con il potenziale cliente ed innescano in esso percezioni sensoriali miste a curiosità. I suoi progetti per la maggior parte si distinguono per la voglia di interazione con il prodotto, perché l'oggetto, lo spazio architettonico, la visione prospettica che ne scaturiscono devono sempre stimolare la persona che ne fruisce garantendo quel momento di personale esclusività che ognuno cerca. Tutor presso la Facoltà di Design presso il Politecnico di Milano, Cultore della materia in Teoria e Storia del Disegno Industriale e tutor nel laboratorio di disegno industriale presso la Facolta di architettura di Palermo, ha partecipato a numerose fiere e mostre in qualità di espositore, fra tutte il Salone Satellite ed il Sasmil Satellite, presso il Salone del Mobile di Milano, lo spazio AMI presso lo SMI (Zurigo), e il Fair Tales di Kortrijk (Belgio) ottenendo interesse da parte della stampa e del pubblico internazionale. Dal 2010 collabora come autore dei volumi dal titolo ""Le ricette dei designer"" edito da Compositori con diverse proposte di food design come il ""Rubino di anguria"", ad oggi prodotto da una nota pasticceria siciliana, gli ""Shanghai di spinaci"", la ""Caponata in gelatina"" ed ultimo ""Eoliana"". Ultimamente selezionato nel progetto Casa Europa, collabora come designer con aziende trevigiane per una collezione di complementi di arredo. Pierfrancesco Arnone, he graduated in Architecture at the University of Palermo. Since 1998, his profession is given to product design and interior design by seeking a combination of primary and processed materials, to give harmony to the forms, identifying elements in everyday and researching methods of recycling waste materials to be applied to design . Moreover, thanks to the contacts with companies from research and product development, is committed to designing products that apply innovative materials. In 2004 he founded his own studio in Bagheria, where he lives and designs his works, which are commissioned by international companies. Its activity covers:Product design: designing the piece of furniture to lighting, from flooring to furniture and worked with various reputed companies both nationally and internationally as Officine Mandelli, Francolight, Fogazza, Waterjet G & G, Calligaris, Snaidero, European.Senior interior designer for Bhartiya City Developers in Bangalore, followed the interior design for private apartments, but his skills are also addressed to the retail and shopfitting, including the design and renovation of public buildings, paying attention to the innovative materials that look out onto the market to feature each environment. In addition, as a home shopper care in all phases of the project offers consulting furniture, interpreting tastes, attitudes and needs of the client, offering its expertise in purchasing or even replace it when required.Fascinated and curious about what is around him considers him as a source of inspiration for his projects, it draws the essence of developing works that interact with potential customers and trigger it in sensory perceptions mixed with curiosity. His designs for the most part are characterized by the desire to interact with the product, because the object, architectural space, the perspective that flow from them must always stimulate the person who benefits from ensuring that moment of personal exclusivity that everyone tries . Tutor at the Faculty of Design at the Politecnico di Milano, Subject Expert in Theory and History of Industrial Design and tutors in the laboratory of industrial design at the School of Architecture in Palermo, has participated in numerous exhibitions and fairs as an exhibitor, including all the Salone Satellite and Satellite Sasmil at the Salone del Mobile in Milan, the space AMI at the SMI (Zurich), and the Fair Tales of Kortrijk (Belgium) getting interest from the international press and the public.

Our designs almost always have nature wrapping around the built spaces with no clear boundaries, where one flows into the other and interior spaces speak with nature and are drenched with light. Our aesthetic approach and design sensibilities are deep rooted in Indianess with a very simple from follows function approach. Space, functions and form envisaged only after many long interactive sessions with the clients often interspersed with lunch/dinner and sometimes even masala dosa timeouts.We love to experiment be it our choices of projects, material, techniques, and design approach. Many a times we have design juries within the office where the floor is thrown open and even the trainees participate in thrashing every design, detail etc and what it results in is a combined collective experience of over 150 years experience. Our team has grown to encompass artists, product designers, sculptors, lighting designers etc who we liaison with closely to enhance almost every project.","['N RESIDENCE GN', 'KANVAL RESIDENCE',

Complex and crucial debates surrounding sustainable design have always led to innovative and densely layered richly textured results. The design process is intensely collaborative and rooted in the real context of the surroundings and functional needs. At the same time a strong artistically and intuitively lead approach brings the art in architecture to the foreground. At NMA we span the scale for future visions, critical propositions, creative ideas and design strategies. We prepare master plans, design buildings, the spaces that hold those buildings and everything that goes inside those buildings. We get into details. We love challenges and working with people who have spirit and the vision raise the bar. We believe design can be empowered with qualities of social, environmental and economic transformation.WE BELIEVE DESIGN CAN CHANGE PEOPLE'S LIVES FOR THE BETTER.",['Vinita Chawla

A deliberate attempt has been made to work across diverse scales in order to focus thoroughly on ‘design’.Archohm is a design studio-offering consultancy for architecture, urban design, interiors, landscape and product design. Spanning across different fields and scales of design, the practice works on infrastructure, township, toll plaza, commercial, retail, institutional, hospitality, corporate, product and residential commissions. Archohm also renders design engineering services. Following its inception in 1999 in india by the virtue of a design competition coupled with an affinity for a cross-cultural dialogue and global exposure on design, archohm launched its studio in the netherlands in 2002 and established an office in libya in 2009 for its middle east operations. True to the vision of design discovery and exposure, through its various activities such as the archoforum, archometer, archotour and initiatives like zolijns, design factory india, the design village and gomaads, archohmendeavors to proliferate local and global design communities.Archohm aims to build architecture that is climatically and contextually relevant. The studio’s design philosophy has been one that creates a dialogue of pure functional forms that are exaggerated by the use of individual materials. This interesting co-existence and conversation of various materials is utilized in all projects to create responsive and responsible architecture.
